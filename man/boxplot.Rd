\arguments{
\item{d}{A dataframe that contains the columns: gene_symbol, group, and value.}

\item{method}{Statistical test to use ("t.test", "wilcox.test", "anova", "kruskal.test").}

\item{log_scale}{Logical; if TRUE, log2 transformation is applied to the value column.}

\item{enable_label}{Logical; if TRUE, sample_id is annotated on the plot.}

\item{custom_theme_fn}{A custom theme function for the plot (optional).}

\item{levels}{Custom ordering of the group factor levels (optional).}

\item{enable_log2fc}{Logical; if TRUE, log2 fold change is calculated and annotated.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the boxplot.
}
\description{
\code{boxplot()} requires a dataframe containing at least three columns: gene_symbol, group, and value.
The gene_symbol column may contain multiple genes, and the value column contains the corresponding gene expression values.
}
\details{
Optionally, an organ column can be included for further grouping, but the function doesn't support the case of multiple genes across multiple groups.

# Example with two genes and two groups
d <- data.frame(

  group = rep(c("Control", "Test"), each = 12),
  value = round(runif(24), 1)
